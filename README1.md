ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning
This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. Based on key features such as passenger class, age, sex, fare, and embarkation point, the model determines the likelihood of survival. An intuitive Gradio interface allows users to interact with the model in real-time.
